# Advent of Code 2021
A curated set of solutions for the 2021 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) problems, written in Rust.

The goals for these solutions are: to be self-contained (using _zero_ external crates), reasonably general (working on every valid input), compact and performant, without going overboard with error handling, custom types or traits.

## Usage

The inputs are expected in the [input](./input/) folder.

Run any of the solutions with `cargo run --release --bin DAY_NUMBER`, or run all with `./run_all.sh`.

Run the tests with `cargo test`.
